This plugin can serve as a general tool for audio classification. The plugin uses a neural network called YAMNet (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/audio/transfer_learning_audio) trained on the AudioSet dataset, an audio dataset with over 500 classes. This plugin can be used to either evaluate all data through an audio stream or be set to scan for particular sounds. Due to the licensing on the AudioSet dataset, the raw training data is unavailable. However, the model provided outputs class scores, embedding vectors, and spectrograms of the input data.  For more specific audio classification tasks, this model can be used for transfer learning, and the outputted feature embeddings can be used to train another model.
